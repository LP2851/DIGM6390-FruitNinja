# DIGM6390-FruitNinja

---

In this project we were tasked with improving a game we created in a project with 3 new significant features, particle effects, sound effects and much more. 

### Significant Features Added

- **Ability System**
  - We added an ability system to the game with 3 showcase abilities which were shockwave (destroy bombs around player), ghost player (a ghost player assists the player in destroying fruit) and seekers (destroying a fruit spawns small seekers that attack nearby fruit). 
- **Store**
  - We added a store system with an in-game currency which is earned by getting points in the game. In the store the player can buy new trails. 
- **Tutorial**
  - We added a tutorial mode which teaches the player how to play the game- teaching movement, slicing fruit and bombs and usage of the ability system.
- **Stronger Fruit**
  - We added special fruits to the game that take multiple hits to destroy.
